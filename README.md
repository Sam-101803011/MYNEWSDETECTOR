# Fake-News-projds2
### Problem Definition

Develop a machine learning program to identify when a news source may be producing fake news. My aim is to use a corpus of labeled real and fake new articles to build a classifier that can make decisions about information based on the content from the corpus. The model will focus on identifying fake news sources, based on multiple articles originating from a source. Once a source is labeled as a producer of fake news, we can predict with high confidence that any future articles from that source will also be fake news. Focusing on sources widens our article misclassification tolerance, because we will have multiple data points coming from each source.

The intended application of the project is for use in applying visibility weights in social media. Using weights produced by this model, social networks can make stories which are highly likely to be fake news less visible.

### Novelty of the project
1. The problem of classifying fake news articles using machine learning models is solved as it had to be done manually which is very cumbersome.
2. Helps in the problem of spread of rumors an false news, which can create hazardous situations.
3. Makes people aware if they are reading correct news or not.
4. Fake news can elevate anti-national sentiments, which can now be prevented.
